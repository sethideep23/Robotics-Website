      Description: <br/>
      <p class="event_description">
      On Friday, members from our FTC and FRC teams went to Murdock-Portal Elementary to demonstrate our robots, as well as teach the second and third graders about the engineering design process.

      <br/>We first performed a skit in which three confused nerds enlisted the audience to brainstorm and build a prototype of a robot to defeat their enemies, including a segment in which the audience gave commands to a human “robot” to demonstrate how instructions are broken down in software to get robots to complete tasks.

      <br/>Then, after school, we had our robots and a maze running with a tiny NXT robot outside, and shared with students, parents, and teachers about our robotics program and FIRST as a whole.

      <br/>Once again, thank you Murdock-Portal for giving us the opportunity to share robotics with your students!
